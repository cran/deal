\title{The number of possible networks}

\description{Calculates the number of different DAG's for a set of
discrete and continuous nodes. }

\usage{
numbermixed(nd,nc)
}

%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{nd}{The number of discrete nodes.}
  \item{nc}{The number of continuous nodes.}
}

\details{
  No arrows are allowed from continuous nodes to discrete nodes. Cycles
  are not allowed. The
  number of networks is given by Bøttcher (2003), using the result in
  Robinson (1977).

  When nd+nc>15, the procedure is quite slow.
}

\value{
  The number of DAG's with the given node configuration.
