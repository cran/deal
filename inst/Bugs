Known bugs and things that needs to be done:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not directly Deal-related:

The irritating sound when drawing graphs can be deactivated in Windows
as follows:
	- Open Control Panel and choose "Sounds and Multimedia"
	- Choose "asterisk" and set sound to "none".

It would be nice, if C-W (not buffered output) was default in R.

In genpicfiles, the pictex() does not use colors of nodes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The position of the nodes should be stored in the node. In the
graphical interface, you should be able to move nodes around and
adjust the position.


When creating a network from a dataframe and arrows are specified so
that the data actually is sparse in the configuration of the discrete
parents, then an error like 
"Error in lsfit(X, y) : 2 responses, but only 3 variables"
or 
"Error in cbind(...) : cannot create a matrix from these types"
occur. (eg. in ksl data with arrows from all nodes pointing to FEV)

The log-score may be positive!! Theoretically this is
nonsense. Apparently, it is due to numeric instability and may be
handled by scaling the observations.

print.node: Conditionals are printed as indices of parents and not
	    names. This is not very pretty... 

learn.node: Check if deal.dll is loaded (No! it has to be loaded,
	    otherwise the First.lib fails). If not, switch to the
            (slower) R versions of postcc and postc0c. Or make an
	    option to the deal procedures.

Latent variables: cannot be handled...

Missing observations: cannot be handled...

network: Should include an option 'saturated' that inserts as many
	 arrows as possible. 

drawnetwork, etc: nw need to be learned before calling these
                  procedures. Instead, do a check and learn it, if it
	          is needed. 

learning: We do not need to learn parameters to calculate
          log-lik. Perhaps this may speed up search. So we need to separate
          parameter learning and likelihood-calculation. 

makesimprob: no dependency in discrete variables

jointprior: when N is too small, we get an error for numerical
            reasons. Find out the minimum N that does not cause an error.

learning: names on parameter matrices on cont. nodes.

prior: remove irrelevant parameters that currently are returned as NA.

Memory problems: Apparently the memory used in the C-programs are not
	         released.
